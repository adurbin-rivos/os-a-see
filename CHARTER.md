# RISC-V AP-TEE TG Charter 

OS-A Supervisor Execution Environment (SEE) will provide a specification for OS/kernel runtime and booting environments to establish a foundation to build binary compatible OSes that work on a variety of RISC-V systems that conform to the OS-A SEE. The primary focus will be establishing software expectations. The specification of the OS-A SEE will be used for the OS-A Platform.
